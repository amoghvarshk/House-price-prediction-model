# House-price-prediction-model

project focused on predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. The
prediction of house prices was crucial in real estate, as it helped buyers, sellers, and investors
make informed decisions. Leveraging the Ames Housing dataset, we aimed to develop accurate
predictive models that could estimate house prices based on various features such as size,
location, and amenities.
